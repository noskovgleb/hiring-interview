### Please describe found weak places below.

#### Security issues

1. ✅ Ensure your application is safeguarded against CSRF attacks.
2. ✅ Eliminate the option for users to manipulate the manager_id on the "extra" page, even if it's hidden in the HTML. Implement a secure method for randomly selecting a manager, either in the controller or the model.
3. ✅ Specify exact keys allowed for mass assignment instead of using `permit!` which allows any keys (breakman)
4. ✅ Store `from_amount_cents` and `to_amount_cents` as big integers instead of integers to accommodate transactions with larger values. The current setup limits transactions to amounts under 21,474,836, causing "out of range" errors.
5. ✅ Ensure that the rendering path does not directly include parameter values, such as render "new_#{params[:type]}", as it may pose security risks. Consider using a more secure approach (breakman)
6. 🔳️ Be aware that the application is vulnerable to Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. This concern can also be considered as a performance issue
7. 🔳️ The application does not enforce the use of HTTPS. It's recommended to enable the config.force_ssl option for improved security.
8. 🔳️ Possible XSS via User Supplied Values to redirect_to. Requires updating ActonPack (bundle-audit)
9. 🔳️ Possible File Disclosure of Locally Encrypted Files. Requires updating ActiveSupport (bundle-audit)

#### Performance issues

1. ✅ Instead of loading all managers into memory and selecting a random one with Manager.all.sample, consider a more efficient approach by obtaining a random manager directly in the model
2. ✅ To address the N+1 query issue in transactions_controller#index, it's essential to load associated managers when retrieving transactions from the database
3. ✅ Optimize the rendering of transaction types (small, large, extra) by using partials. This can improve the code structure and performance.
4. 🔳️ Consider adding pagination to the transaction page. This improvement will be especially valuable as the list of transactions grows larger.

#### Code issues

Controllers
1. ✅ The business logic related to assigning managers should be refactored out of the controller. Consider moving this logic to a more appropriate location, such as a service object or model, to improve code organization and maintainability
2. ✅ Remove the new_large and new_extra_large methods in the transaction_controller as they are not utilized. This cleanup can help streamline the controller and eliminate unnecessary code
3. ✅ Implement error handling for the specific case of ActiveRecord::RecordNotFound in the TransactionsController#show action. This ensures a more graceful handling of record not found errors.
4. 🔳️ The application currently allows the creation of large and extra-large transactions with amounts less than $100 and $1000, respectively. To improve validation and prevent such transactions, consider revising and strengthening the validation process
5. Enhance code organization by implementing decorators or helpers for methods like client_full_name. This will improve the maintainability and readability of the code
Models
6. 🔳️ The use of SecureRandom.hex(5) for generating transaction IDs is tightly coupled to a specific class (SecureRandom). To enhance flexibility and maintainability, consider moving the generation of transaction IDs to a service object. This approach allows for easier changes in the future without being dependent on a particular class, like SecureRandom.
7. 🔳️ To maintain code quality, consider using Git hooks to automatically check your code with linters like Rubocop at the development stage. Additionally, in the future, extend this practice to the CI (Continuous Integration) level for comprehensive code quality checks
8. 🔳️ Currently, the manager_id column is defined as a bigint type in the database, which may be unnecessary. Consider reviewing the data requirements and constraints to determine if a smaller integer type can be used for better optimization.


#### Others

1. ✅ The controller `TransactionsController` has been partially covered with tests
2. 🔳️ For future scalability and deployment, consider containerizing the application using Docker. This will make it easier to manage and scale the application if it goes into production
3. 🔳️ To enhance the project's security, consider utilizing tools like bundle-audit and Brakeman for identifying and addressing potential security vulnerabilities
4. 🔳️ Enhance test coverage by adding more unit and integration tests to ensure comprehensive code testing and maintain code quality
